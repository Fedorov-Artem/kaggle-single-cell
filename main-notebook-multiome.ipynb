    "# **Main Multiome Notebook**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the main notebook for multiome part of the project, where the task is to predict gene expression levels given information about TF_IDF normalized chromatin accessibility data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter notebook, data from several sources is joined together and is used further to create predictions for the test dataset. The sources are:\n",
    "* pre-calculated Truncated SVD values from chromatin accessibility data (see Prepare_SVD_for_multiome notebook);\n",
    "* source data for three input features to be used as is;\n",
    "* metadata - donor ID and day each cell was analyzed, some features are built using metadata information;\n",
    "* target values for the train set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target includes 23000 genes. Kaggle notebook can hardly fit all the target values in available memory, and there is no possibility to fit an individual model for each of 23000 targets. So, I calculate TruncatedSVD components for the target data, predict the TruncatedSVD components and then calculate the predicted targets by using reverse operation to TruncatedSVD calculation. To further improve results, I build 4 models predicting TruncatedSVD components calculated with different random seeds and then calculate the average prediction."
